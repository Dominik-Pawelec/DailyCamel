# I WANNA MAKE A WEBSITE THAT GENERATES DAILY CAMEL IN ASCII (BECAUSE IT'S ABSURD)

## How Will I archieve this ambitious task?
No idea! But will figure it out sooner than later

##**POTENTIAL PLAN:**
1. Host a website with proper domain (like Ocaml.com or dailycamel.live)
2. Make it able to interact with python code
3. Implement chatgpt API to create completely normal camels
4. More features to website, like more language models or some interaction??
5. Make website more secure I guess
